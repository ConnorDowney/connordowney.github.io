  <h1>Streakz — Terms &amp; Promotion Rules</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 30, 2026</p>

  <p>This document describes the Terms &amp; Conditions that govern account eligibility and Streakz promotions, contests, giveaways, and drawings (collectively, "Promotions"), each sponsored by Downey Digital LLC ("Company," "we," "us," or "our"). By creating an account, using the App, or participating in a Promotion, you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App or participate.</p>

  <h2>1. Eligibility &amp; Accounts</h2>

    <li><strong>Age:</strong> You must be at least 18 years old to create an account or participate in Promotions.</li>
    <li><strong>Accurate information:</strong> You must provide accurate information during sign-up and when requested for eligibility verification.</li>
    <li><strong>One account per person:</strong> Unless explicitly allowed for a particular Promotion, you may have only one account.</li>
    <li><strong>Verification:</strong> We may require additional information to verify eligibility. Failure to provide requested verification may result in disqualification.</li>
    <li><strong>Void where prohibited:</strong> Promotions are void where prohibited by law.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. General Promotion Terms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No purchase necessary:</strong> Promotions are free and require no purchase. Virtual tokens have no monetary value.</li>

    <li><strong>Entry periods:</strong> Picks must be submitted before the bet closes. Picks submitted after closure are void.</li>
    <li><strong>Pick availability &amp; timing:</strong> The Company may post daily picks at its discretion. We generally intend to post picks at least one (1) hour before scheduled game start time. If a pick is posted less than one (1) hour before scheduled game start time, we may designate that date as a free pick day.</li>
    <li><strong>Fraud/abuse:</strong> We may disqualify entries, suspend leagues, and/or suspend accounts for fraud, abuse, automation, creating multiple accounts, or conduct that compromises the integrity of the App or a Promotion.</li>
    <li><strong>Responsibility for league content:</strong> League owners are responsible for content posted in their leagues, including custom bets and messages. We reserve the right to remove inappropriate content and suspend users who violate these terms.</li>
